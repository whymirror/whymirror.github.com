Re-rooting trees for _why's projects as maintainers step forward

Hi! 

In #1191, @tekkub said you all can manually repair the fractionated / rootless trees left behind by _why's departure.

Here are projects started by why where a lead custodian has stepped forward:

* http://github.com/bterlson/blimlimb
* http://github.com/camping/camping
* http://github.com/rkh/mixico
* http://github.com/evaryont/mousehole
* http://github.com/fogus/potion
* http://github.com/jgarber/redcloth
* http://github.com/indeyets/syck
* http://github.com/devyn/unholy

The running count is up at http://whymirror.github.com/

If you like, leave this issue open and I will append more names as they roll in; or I can wait and batch them up as separate issues.

I've got you down as the maintainer of mousehole. You are awesome! Would you please take a peek at http://whymirror.github.com/ for the state of the whymirror and the note about mousehole?

Github tech support will make your repo the "root" node. At some point we may make whymirror's repo a fork with no content, just a readme pointing back to the head.  Let us know if you require changes to either http://whymirror.github.com/ or the whymirror fork.

Also, I made a skeleton gh-pages (the best place to migrate the documentation) for each repo, including CSS and a template index.html. So if you'd like, do a quick pull from whymirror's copy. (You'll have to use some fancypants git command to add the gh-pages branch: see the documentation at http://pages.github.com)


Thank you so much for your work. The response from the community has been extraordinary -- it's a remarkable testament to _why and to the ruby community.

We need github tech support to make one repo the "root" node. At some point we may make whymirror's repo a fork with no content, just a readme pointing back to the head.  Let us know if you require changes to either http://whymirror.github.com/ or the whymirror fork.

Great! I've got you down as the maintainer of hobix.  <a href="http://github.com/crnixon">crnixon</a> has volunteered to help as well: "I can get the online installer and site back up and running this week ... [and] continue to improve it in the spirit of _why." Would you mind getting in touch with crnixon directly?

See http://whymirror.github.com/ for notes on hobix and on state of the whymirror.

Thanks for your note on redcloth!

For some time, <a href="http://github.com/jgarber">jgarber</a> has been head of the <a href="http://redcloth.org/">Redcloth</a> team, apologies that I missed this.

Users JGailor, faithfulgeek and jbarnette have volunteered to help, I'm hoping you can work together to integrate the documentation. Faithfulgeek says "I wanted to let you know I've grabbed _why's Textile reference that was up on hobix.com and uploaded it to my server. It can be accessed at http://faithfulgeek.org/textile.html. The dead version is at top of the google results for textile, so I figure it was probably getting some use. Can you let people know on the mirror of the new location?"

If you can, get in touch directly with jgarber, JGailor, faithfulgeek and jbarnette (ie. please don't cc whymirror -- but please do ask for any help you need).

Thank you so much for volunteering. The response from the community has been extraordinary -- it's a remarkable testament to _why and to the ruby community.
