After hearing about _why's departure, in a foolish gust of barnraising I set up a central mirror of _why's projects on github (http://github.com/whymirror).  Then I realized I could never handle the eternity of emails from that account alone... so I spammed each ex-_why repo I could find with a pull request asking for a new maintainer and help recovering missing projects.

Check out http://whymirror.github.com for the results.

Within 48 hours, dozens of people have stepped forward with contributions. Volunteers have come forward to take over management of the projects, and currently 15 out of 23 projects have custodians. We believe all the major code projects have been recovered, now hosted on github (check whymirror for a list).  Github management are helping to untangle the projects' networks to be rooted by the new maintainers. Seth Rasmussen (@greatseth) has stepped up to help manage whymirror.

This is an amazing testament to the ruby community. If _why's disappearing act is a test, I think we'll pass.

There's more to go, however, until his works are fully decentralized.  Here's how you can help:

== Several projects still need maintainers: ==

* Most importantly, [hpricot] needs a maintainer, though @ecarnevale has volunteered to help that person. (hpricot may already have a maintainer, and I apologize if that's the case).

* A couple people have reluctantly stepped forward to run the [shoes] project, but they could use help.

* hacketyhack exists in a couple different states and needs a custodian. See http://whymirror.github.com

* 8cpj, fakeplus, hoodwinkd, sandbox and yown all need custodians.  These should be low-traffic given their age and size.

* If any of the projects (listed as with or without custodians) already have a defacto custodian, please let us know -- there are no coups, only volunteers stepping forward to pitch in.

== Recover missing code ==

The major projects have been found, but there's still some stuff missing

* The "Try Ruby" code is missing.  This would be a grave loss if we can't find it.  Also will need a custodian of course.

* If you have SVN pulls from code.whytheluckystiff.net, please check the date against the repos on github.com -- yours may be more recent.

* There's one repo from rubyforge -- http://rubyforge.org/projects/dns-zone -- that may have been a why project.  Anyone own this? If you have code, please set up a github repo and message whymirror.

== Documentation recovery ==

There was a wealth of documentation on whytheluckystiff.net, hobix.com, etc. Some of that can be recovered from archive.org and the google cache, but we should act fast. Contact the custodian of the corresponding project if you'll help migrate content.

The best solution is to land that documentation into the repo's github pages branch -- that makes it live within the repo and doesn't require transmutation out of HTML. I made a skeleton gh-pages for each repo in whymirror's branch, including CSS and a template index.html borrowed from @mojombo. (You'll have to use some fancypants git command to add the gh-pages branch: see the documentation at http://pages.github.com)

Thanks for your help,

Re-rooting trees for _why's projects as maintainers step forward

Hi! 

In #1191, @tekkub said you all can manually repair the fractionated / rootless trees left behind by _why's departure.

Here are projects started by why where a lead custodian has stepped forward:

* http://github.com/bterlson/blimlimb
* http://github.com/camping/camping
* http://github.com/rkh/mixico
* http://github.com/evaryont/mousehole
* http://github.com/fogus/potion
* http://github.com/jgarber/redcloth
* http://github.com/indeyets/syck
* http://github.com/devyn/unholy

The running count is up at http://whymirror.github.com/

If you like, leave this issue open and I will append more names as they roll in; or I can wait and batch them up as separate issues.

I've got you down as the maintainer of mousehole. You are awesome! Would you please take a peek at http://whymirror.github.com/ for the state of the whymirror and the note about mousehole?

Github tech support will make your repo the "root" node. At some point we may make whymirror's repo a fork with no content, just a readme pointing back to the head.  Let us know if you require changes to either http://whymirror.github.com/ or the whymirror fork.

Also, I made a skeleton gh-pages (the best place to migrate the documentation) for each repo, including CSS and a template index.html. So if you'd like, do a quick pull from whymirror's copy. (You'll have to use some fancypants git command to add the gh-pages branch: see the documentation at http://pages.github.com)


Thank you so much for your work. The response from the community has been extraordinary -- it's a remarkable testament to _why and to the ruby community.

Great! I've got you down as the maintainer of hobix.  <a href="http://github.com/crnixon">crnixon</a> has volunteered to help as well: "I can get the online installer and site back up and running this week ... [and] continue to improve it in the spirit of _why." Would you mind getting in touch with crnixon directly?

See http://whymirror.github.com/ for notes on hobix and on state of the whymirror.

Thanks for your note on redcloth!

For some time, <a href="http://github.com/jgarber">jgarber</a> has been head of the <a href="http://redcloth.org/">Redcloth</a> team, apologies that I missed this.

Users JGailor, faithfulgeek and jbarnette have volunteered to help, I'm hoping you can work together to integrate the documentation. Faithfulgeek says "I wanted to let you know I've grabbed _why's Textile reference that was up on hobix.com and uploaded it to my server. It can be accessed at http://faithfulgeek.org/textile.html. The dead version is at top of the google results for textile, so I figure it was probably getting some use. Can you let people know on the mirror of the new location?"

If you can, get in touch directly with jgarber, JGailor, faithfulgeek and jbarnette (ie. please don't cc whymirror -- but please do ask for any help you need).

Thank you so much for volunteering. The response from the community has been extraordinary -- it's a remarkable testament to _why and to the ruby community.
