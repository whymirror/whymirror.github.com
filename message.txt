You're awesome. You're both also the new bloopsaphone maintainers; see http://whymirror.github.com/ for more.

I've added you as admins on whymirror's copy, but I'm going to ask github tech support to make one of yours the "root" node -- please let me know which one. At some point you'll do a pull request to the whole tree, and then I'll make whymirror's repo a fork of yours with no content, just a readme pointing back to the source.

I made a skeleton gh-pages (the best place to migrate the documentation) for
each repo, including CSS and a template index.html. So if you'd like, do a quick
pull from whymirror's copy. (You'll have to use some fancypants git command to
add the gh-pages branch: see the documentation at http://pages.github.com)

Once you've worked out the details let us know if you require changes to either http://whymirror.github.com/ or the whymirror fork.

Thank you so much for volunteering. The response from the community has been extraordinary -- it's a remarkable testament to _why and to the ruby community.

For some time, <a href="http://github.com/jasongarber">jasongarber</a> has been head of the <a href="http://redcloth.org/">Redcloth</a> team, apologies that I missed this.

Users JGailor, faithfulgeek and jbarnette have volunteered to help, I'm hoping they can work together to integrate the documentation

Faithfulgeek says "I wanted to let you know I've grabbed _why's Textile reference that was up on hobix.com and uploaded it to my server. It can be accessed at http://faithfulgeek.org/textile.html. The dead version is at top of the google results for textile, so I figure it was probably getting some use. Can you let people know on the mirror of the new location?"
