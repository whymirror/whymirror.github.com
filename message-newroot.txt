Hi,
This isn't really a pull request, it's a bulk email wrapping up the whymirror project (http://whymirror.github.com).

This is about the UNHOLY project.

## Canonical heads of repos on github ##

I've just put in a support request for that repo to become the bless'ed root -- all other repo's will read "Fork of thatname/thisproject".
  http://support.github.com/discussions/repos/1264-bless-new-heads-for-fork-trees-of-_whys-projects

This is necessary because _why's disappearance left some arbitrary fork to be displayed as the root, but the person shown above volunteered to be the head maintainer. Read more at whymirror.github.com

If any of the following are true:

* Somehow I think you're the head maintainer, but I've misunderstood -- you're not and you don't want to be
* You think you're the head maintainer but some other random person is named above
* You're pretty sure somebody else has been serving as the de facto head maintainer, not the person named above

then please

* respond immediately to this github ticket: http://support.github.com/discussions/repos/1264-bless-new-heads-for-fork-trees-of-_whys-projects
* contact the relevant parties and identify the proper head maintainer
* let whymirror and github know who the maintainer actually is. Thanks!

(There are absolutely no politics involved, we have no idea how this project functions, this is not a coup -- we're just trying to identify a single point of contact for each repo. Please forgive any misunderstanding.)

## Plea for help ##

Even if you're not the maintainer, this project needs people to help migrate its documentation into the gh-pages branch.  Documentation is the hardest part of any project and it risks being lost as the pages decay from google's cache.  See http://whymirror.github.com/#pleasehelp for how to help move documentation.

## And so adieu ##

Finally, please note that **once this transition has taken place, whymirror will be checked infrequently**. Users @mrflip and @greatseth have been running it, but with the projects decentralized we figure our job is done.  The maintainers for each project have push rights into whymirror's repos (/contact us if this isn't the case/) but the canonical copy is the maintainer's.  If you think whymirror requires some ongoing role, please contact us and we'll let you drive the account.

Thanks again to all the people who have volunteered, 

mrflip / flip@infochimps.org for the whymirror.



===========================================================================

Not really a pull request -- more of a question.  We're trying to wrap up the whymirror project, read more at http://whymirror.github.com and  http://support.github.com/discussions/repos/1264-bless-new-heads-for-fork-trees-of-_whys-projects
  
Evaryont has volunteered to be head maintainer of mousehole, and if I understand correctly hoodwinkd and mousehole are intertwingled projects (?).  

Right now robbyrussell is shown as the github head of the tree and so will be getting all the pull requests, but hasn't publicly announced he'd like to be head of the project. (Apologies if any of the preceding is inaccurate.)

Anyway, if anyone is interested in being maintainer please contact evaryont and robbyrussell and then let whymirror know.
