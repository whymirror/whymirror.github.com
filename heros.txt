Here's a list of all the whymirror repos / known projects.  Blessed (head) maintainer in left column, lieutenants in the middle column, random dudes left as the bless'ed root when _why disapeared in the right column.

These projects were forked from _why.  The hero listed is the head maintainer, and so where the project tree has fractionated the indicated person's tree should be blessed.  (While any of the projects have multiple custodians, the indicated branches should be the blessed one).

For each of the following projects, please bless the indicated hero as the root for that project's tree.

    ** Project **          ** Hero **      ** Needs Blessing **

Mislav has what's emerged as the canonical version of _why's Poignant guide to Ruby. No changes necessary here.

Parolkar and Sophrinix are reviving TryRuby.  Only change here I think is to make parolkar the head of all sandbox trees.

    TryRuby                Sophrinix       
    required-sec...tryruby Sophrinix
    sandbox                parolkar        
    why_sandbox            parolkar        

These are just re-imports of SVN code lying around. Shouldn't need to change anything.

    fakeplus               (fogus)
    processor              fogus
    rb_parse_args          fogus
    skistrap               fogus

These don't have maintainers yet -- the roots that github shows haven't responded to pull requests (or I didn't see the response). Hoodwinkd should probably go with mousehole, evaryont and robbyrussell has been pinged.

These are still missing; yup has an old svn but hasn't github'd it yet.
