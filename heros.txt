These projects were forked from _why.  The hero listed has replied to whymirror, volunteering to become the head maintainer -- where the git tree has fractionated the indicated person's tree should be blessed.  (While any of the projects have multiple custodians, the indicated branches should be the blessed one).

Would you please bless the indicated hero as the root for each project's tree?

I think only the ones with '!!!!' need their roots changed. 

Mislav has what's emerged as the canonical version of _why's Poignant guide to Ruby. No changes necessary here.

    poignant-guide         mislav
    poignantguide          luigi
    why-archive            steveklabnik
    poignant-br            carlosbrando

These are just re-imports of SVN code lying around. Shouldn't need to change anything.

    fakeplus               (fogus)

    rb_parse_args          fogus
    skistrap               fogus

These don't have maintainers yet -- the roots that github shows haven't responded to pull requests (or I didn't see the response).

    yown                                   (iamjwc_)
    superredcloth                          (skwp)           yup

These are still missing; yup has an old svn but hasn't github'd it yet. smtlaissezfaire will answer pull requests when they reappear.

Oh now I get it. 

Just took a quick tour though the list of repos; all of them look right except

    hobix               hobix  
    hpricot             hpricot
    camping             camping
      http://github.com/camping/camping/network/members
      http://github.com/zimbatm/camping/network/members
    markaby             markaby
      http://github.com/giraffesoft/markaby/network/members
      http://github.com/markaby/markaby/network/members

The last two have multiple-headed trees. 

That should close out this request, thanks again for the fixing.

Whymirror's parent is non-root: bloopsaphone, camping, hacketyhack, hobix, hoodwinkd, hpricot, markaby, parkplace, unholy
